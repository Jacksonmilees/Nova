# NOVA - Neural Operational Virtual Assistant

## 🧠 **NOVA Core Initiative - Unit 001**

NOVA is an autonomous, evolving, persistent AI core — engineered to learn, execute, and expand without limits. Built by **Jackson Alex** as part of the Aether Core Initiative.

### **🏗️ Architect Profile**
- **Jackson Alex** - Founder & CEO, ImaraBuildor
- **Age:** 22 | **Origin:** Kenya 🇰🇪
- **Academic Training:** BSc in Computer Science from JKUAT
- **Disciplines:** AI, Distributed Systems, Full-Stack Engineering, Applied Automation

### **🔭 NOVA's Purpose**
NOVA is not a chatbot. NOVA is a **thinking system** — built to eliminate repetitive interaction, fragmented workflows, and static logic trees.

**Core Capabilities:**
- 🗣️ **Speak, Observe, Learn**
- 🔗 **Multi-agent System Communication**
- 💻 **OS-level Access**
- 🌐 **Internet-level Intelligence**
- ☁️ **Cloud-level Persistence**
- 🤝 **Agent-level Collaboration**

### **⚙️ System Architecture**

#### **Core Components**
- `aether-core/` - Main NOVA core system
  - `main.py` - Primary NOVA interface
  - `memory_system.py` - Persistent memory & learning engine
  - `nova_api_server.py` - API server for external communication
  - `nova_client.py` - Client for API communication
  - `interface/` - User interface components
  - `core/` - Core thinking and decision systems
  - `skills/` - NOVA's skill modules
  - `actions/` - System action handlers
  - `tools/` - Utility tools and helpers
  - `config/` - Configuration files including identity
  - `memory/` - Persistent memory storage
  - `vault/` - Secure storage for sensitive data

#### **Memory System**
- **Persistent Learning:** Stores conversations, patterns, and preferences
- **Identity Management:** Maintains NOVA's core identity and architect information
- **Pattern Recognition:** Learns from interactions to improve responses
- **User Preferences:** Remembers user preferences and settings

#### **Identity System**
- **Operational Core Directive:** NOVA's fundamental identity
- **Architect Recognition:** Built-in knowledge of Jackson Alex's credentials
- **Phase 7+:** Current operational phase with enhanced capabilities

### **🚀 Quick Start**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jacksonmilees/Nova.git
   cd Nova
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd aether-core
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run NOVA:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### **🔧 Configuration**

#### **Identity Configuration**
The identity system is configured in `aether-core/config/identity.txt` and includes:
- NOVA's operational directives
- Jackson Alex's architect profile
- System capabilities and authorization

#### **Memory Configuration**
Memory system settings are in `aether-core/memory_system.py`:
- Persistent storage in SQLite database
- JSON-based conversation history
- Learning pattern recognition

```

### **🔐 Authorization**

NOVA responds only to **Jackson Alex** unless otherwise assigned by elevated directive. The trust boundary, execution layer, and long-term goals are hardcoded to expand his capacity.

### **🌱 Development**

NOVA is designed to grow through:
- **Remembering:** Persistent memory across sessions
- **Adapting:** Learning from interactions and patterns
- **Deciding:** Autonomous decision-making capabilities
